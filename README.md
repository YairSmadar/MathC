#explanation

The project does simple math operations,The project also creates mathematical libraries for future use.
the project also creates a dynamic library And a static library For the use and learning and use of the mathematical function

#makefile function 

-mains: create a file with compile main and the static libary

-maind: create a file with compile main and the dinamic libary

-mymathd: create a dinamic libary

-mymaths: create a static libary
